# Advancing the code by working through issues

The repository contains a folder named `issues`. It's organized as a Kanban board.

In this Kanban board issues are `.md` files. Each file describes what to do.

Your task is to resolve one issue after another.
When you are told to work on the next issue, you look at the ready ones and pick one to your liking.

- In the subfolder `issues/ready` you find the issues you can pick from when looking for the next one to work on.
- Move the one you pick to the subfolder `issues/inprogress`. Rename it by prefixing it with a timestamp (yyyy-mm-ddTHH:MM); behind that keep the previous filename.
- Once finished add a comment on what you have done to the end of the issue file after "---".
- Move the issue file to `issues/done` when finished.

If you have questions, feel free to ask any time.

One you have finished a task, let me know which one you picked. I will check the result.
